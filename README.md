# Movination
Project developed for the phase two of our internship. This project could be seen as a clone of IMDB.
In our website, you can search for different movies, add them to your watchlist and give them a rating. You can also see the raiting for each existent movie.
Furthermore, you can see details about a specific movie and even receive suggestions for other movies with the same category in the order of raitings. You can see movies grouped by category.
We also designed an admin page where you can add a movie, modify an existing movie, delete a movie and see movies from a specific category.
Each of the pages with multiple elements has a pagination (See homepage and admin page, respectively.)

Main technologies: 
Backend => Java, Spring MVC, Spring Security 
Frontend => JSP files, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery
